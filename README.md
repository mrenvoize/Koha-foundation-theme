Koha-foundation-theme
=====================
A Koha OPAC theme based upon Zurb Foundation!

This theme is an experiment into developing a fully functional [Koha](http://koha-community.org/ "Koha Community") OPAC theme using the feature rich [Zurb Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/ "Zurb Foundation") front-end framework as a starting point.  Foundation 3.0 uses the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/ "Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets") css pre-processor, and this project takes those as a basis so you can use this modern css styling system too.
